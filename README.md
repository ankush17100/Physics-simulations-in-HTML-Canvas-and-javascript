The credit for the boilerplate goes to [ChrisCourses](https://github.com/christopher4lis). I am very grateful for his courses on youtube.

I just modified the javascript code to try to simulate actual physics and try to make it adhere to the 'law of conservation of energy'. I didn't get the physics right - if anything, it's horribly wrong, since energy seems to be increasing out of nowwhere.

What's really fascinating to me and my main reason of creating this repo is that when simulating these collisions the balls seem to reach an equilibrium. 

I want to know more and try to find out some literature or laws regarding this and query people who are knowledgable in the physics and mathematics of such collisions. 

I am also aware that this might be just the result of my implementation and not really related to actual physics or mathematics since I don't claim that this is 'right' and I will consider and entertain the possibility that this is utter nonsense. But in anycase it's interesting and fascinating.

Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/ankush17100/Physics-simulations-in-HTML-Canvas-and-javascript.git

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start
        or
        webpack

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000.
